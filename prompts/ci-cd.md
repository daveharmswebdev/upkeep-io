I want to get the ci-cd pipeline going.  

read

.github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled 

that is the ci-cd work flow, but I disabled by modifying the extension.

We are not ready for railway yet.  

What I would like to see is some preparation.

And I think that looks like testing and build.  So that we should be able to run tests, have them pass and then build artifacts.

I assume that we will be building a container for railway.  

Long story short we are preparing for deploying this app to railway.  But I don't want to set the railway envs.  I do not have a railway account yet.
